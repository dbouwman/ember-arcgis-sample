ember-arcgis-sample
=================
A simple example that shows how to use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript with EmberJS.

## Getting Started
This sample uses some minimal nodejs based tooling to streamline development. 

1. Install Nodejs on your system
1. Install gulp as a globally accessible node tool `npm install -g gulp`
1. Install bower as a globally accessible node tool `npm install -g bower`
1. cd into the ember-arcgis-sample folder
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install`
1. Start the app `gulp`

### Tooling
At this point we've just added some very simply tooling 
- a local node serve to host the app
- a watch to auto-reload the app when the html file changes
- a watch to lint the js files when they change, and then reload the app

There are a ton of other things that could be added to this example app, but for now, this is a good minimal set to help with development.
